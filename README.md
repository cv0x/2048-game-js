# The 2048 Game in JavaScript
Welcome to our implementation of the "2048" game programmed in JavaScript. 
This project is created as part of the "Street of Code" course.
(https://streetofcode.sk/kurzy/webove-hry)

The game will start when you make first move. 
The starting playing field has two randomly generated four-digit numbers. 
The goal of the game is to combine the same numbers so that you reach the number "2048".

**Controls:**

- Move with arrow keys on keyboard.
- You can only combine identical numbers.

Would you like to open the game and try it yourself? You can play here: https://cv0x.github.io/2048-game-js/
